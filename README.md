# [MOVED - this is now DxCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore)
Yeah, yeah - I very nearly committed the same grave sin as I had when I named megaTinyCore: mistaking the target chip as having anything to do with what might be called "mega" anything. They're not "ATmega" parts, nor do any official documents describe then as megaAVR, ergo the word "mega" has no place in the core name.
