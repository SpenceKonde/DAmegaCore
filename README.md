# [MOVED - this is now DxCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore)
Yeah, yeah - I very nearly committed the same grave sin as I had when I named megaTinyCore: mistaking the target chip as having anything to do with what might be called "mega" anything. They're not "ATmega" parts, nor do any official documents describe then as megaAVR, ergo the word "mega" has no place in the core name. 

For a time during development it was named DACore (printed on some versions of the boards I sell); that repo was renamed correctly and redirects automatically - obviously if it were to support the (then only rumored, now recently released) DB series, it shouldn't be named DACore; DB-series is almost identical to DA-series (more similar than I could have hoped for) and supporting them with different cores would be madness.
